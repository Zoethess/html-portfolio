<p>Hello world! My name is Zoe and I was born in Thessaloniki, Greece, Europe. <br />
   I love my country so much and I can't imagine myself living somewhere else but Greece. <br />
   I consider my country as a blessed place to live, work and be in general. <br />
   At the age of 50 I discovered the wonderful world of coding and front end development. <br />
    It is such a challenge for me this area!
  
</p>

<p>I have a few hobbies including:
   <ul>
      <li>Photography (both taking and editing),</li>
      <li>Video editing,</li>
      <li>Code writting,</li>
      <li>Walking,</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<p>I love walking by the beach and taking photos. This is something that I do very often. I wish I could do it every day! <br />
   Maybe one day I will be living close to the sea again, It's one of my dreams...</p>
