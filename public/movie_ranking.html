<p>It's a Wonderful Life is a 1946 American Christmas fantasy drama film produced and directed by Frank Capra. <br />
   On Christmas Eve 1945, in Bedford Falls, New York, George Bailey contemplates suicide. <br />

<p>The Ten Commandments is a 1956 American epic religious drama film produced, directed, and narrated by Cecil B. DeMille. <br />
   After hearing the prophecy of a Hebrew deliverer, Pharaoh Rameses I of Egypt orders the death of all newborn Hebrew males. <br />
   Yochabel saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile. <br />
   Bithiah, the Pharaoh Rameses's recently widowed daughter (and sister of the future Pharaoh Seti I), finds the basket <br />
   and decides to adopt the boy, even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes that the child is Hebrew. <br />
   Bithiah names the baby Moses.</p>
<h3>Ben-Hur (1959)</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/Ben_Hur-359300410-large.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="Ben Hur film picture" />
<p>Ben-Hur is a 1959 American epic religious film directed by William Wyler, produced by Sam Zimbalist, and <br />
   starring Charlton Heston as the title character. <br />
   I like watching this movie every Easter. This movie is full of "messages" such as <br />
   love for your parents-family and God, to keep fighting in order to survive, <br />
   letting hate feed you just to keep you alive but eventually the good part of you will win, and love as well. <br />
   Although there is reference to Jesus, his miracles, speeches, etc, the viewer never sees his face, <br />
   just the backside of his body or from a very distant view.</p>
